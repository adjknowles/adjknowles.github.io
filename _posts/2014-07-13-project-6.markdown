description: This was my final project and is a web-based app that allows users to share their local knowledge about their hometown. Initially I created the back-end API and ran tests in the mongo database and Insomnia. I then focused on the front-end, implementing the Google APIs and creating the partial view pages. After this I concentrated on the styling, using Bootstrap as the front-end CSS framework as well as custom CSS.
technology: HTML5, CSS3, Node JS, Express, Angular JS, MongoDB and Bootstrap.
