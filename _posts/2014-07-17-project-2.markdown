description: A web-based app allowing students and teachers to register to initiate and organise music lessons. The student can search by city and instrument to find their perfect music teacher. I created the Ruby on Rails application using the Ruby gem Devise, after which I implemented some basic styling for the users to register, login and logout. Once this was done I was able to install further Ruby gems such as Ransack, which created the search features. I then styled the app using Foundation and custom CSS.
technology: HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery and Foundation.
